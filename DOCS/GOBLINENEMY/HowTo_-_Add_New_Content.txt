This system is designed so you can add new content without editing any core logic scripts (like SpawnDirector or GameController).

	How to Add a New Behavior (e.g., "Ranged Attack")

Go to the Behaviors folder.

	Create a new ModuleScript named RangedAttack.

	Write the logic. The module should have an .Execute(attackerModel, target) function, just like MeleeAttack.

		File: Behaviors/RangedAttack.lua (Example)
		Lua

		local RangedAttack = {}

		function RangedAttack.Execute(attackerModel, target)
			print(attackerModel.Name .. " is firing a projectile at " .. target.Name)
			-- Logic to create a projectile, aim it, and fire
		end

		return RangedAttack

		How to Add a New Foe (e.g., "Orc")

		Go to the FoeConfigs folder.

		Copy Goblin.lua and Paste it.

		Rename the copy to Orc.lua.

		Open Orc.lua and edit its contents.

		File: FoeConfigs/Orc.lua (Example)
		Lua

		-- Point to the behaviors folder
		local Behaviors = script.Parent.Parent.Behaviors

		local OrcConfig = {
			Name = "Orc",
			-- Make sure you have an "Orc" model in ServerStorage.EnemyModels
			Model = game.ServerStorage.EnemyModels.Orc, 

			-- Stats
			Health = 250,
			WalkSpeed = 10,

			-- Behaviors (Point to the *same* attack)
			AttackBehavior = require(Behaviors.MeleeAttack),

			-- Spawning Data (Orcs are rarer than Goblins)
			SpawnWeight = 5 
		}

		return OrcConfig

		That's it. The game will now automatically load the "Orc" and add it to the spawn list with a weight of 5.

		How to Add a "Goblin Shaman" (Mixed Behaviors)

		This shows the true power of composition.

		Create RangedAttack.lua (see first step).

		Create HealSelf.lua (another behavior).

		Copy Goblin.lua and rename it GoblinShaman.lua.

		Edit the file.

		File: FoeConfigs/GoblinShaman.lua (Example)
		Lua

		local Behaviors = script.Parent.Parent.Behaviors

		local GoblinShamanConfig = {
			Name = "Goblin Shaman",
			-- It can REUSE the Goblin model
			Model = game.ServerStorage.EnemyModels.Goblin, 

			-- Stats
			Health = 75,
			WalkSpeed = 12,

			-- Behaviors (Give it NEW behaviors)
			AttackBehavior = require(Behaviors.RangedAttack),
			UtilityBehavior = require(Behaviors.HealSelf), -- (You would use this in FoeController)

			-- Spawning Data
			SpawnWeight = 2 -- Very rare
		}

		return GoblinShamanConfig

		You just created a new enemy type that reuses a model but has completely different logic, all without duplicating code or editing core systems.
