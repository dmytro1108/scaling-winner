This guide explains how to tweak existing game balance and settings. All tuning is done in one file.

File to Edit: ServerScriptService/ENEMY1/Services/Config.lua

How to Change...

    Max Enemies on Map:

        Find: MaxPopulation

        Tweak: Change the number. 50 means 50 enemies will be alive at once.

    Spawn Speed:

        Find: SpawnInterval

        Tweak: Change the number (in seconds). 1 means the SpawnDirector tries to spawn a foe every second.

    Spawn Area:

        Find: SpawnAreaSize and MinSpawnRadius

        Tweak: These define the outer and inner circles for spawning. (This assumes you've implemented the positioning logic in SpawnDirector).

    Randomness (Seed):

        Find: WORLD_SEED

        Tweak: Change this number to get a completely different "random" spawn sequence. Useful for testing.

    Asset Paths:

        Find: Paths.EnemyModels or Paths.EnemyContainer

        Tweak: If you move your models in ServerStorage or want to put enemies in a different Workspace folder, change the paths here.

How to Change... (Foe Specific)

    Goblin Stats (Health, Speed):

        File to Edit: ServerScriptService/ENEMY1/FoeConfigs/Goblin.lua

        Tweak: Change the Health or WalkSpeed values.

    Goblin Rarity:

        File to Edit: ServerScriptService/ENEMY1/FoeConfigs/Goblin.lua

        Tweak: Change the SpawnWeight value. A higher number means it's more common.

        Example: If Goblin.SpawnWeight = 10 and Orc.SpawnWeight = 5, Goblins are twice as likely to spawn.
