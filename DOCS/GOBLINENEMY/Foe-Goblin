How to Change...

    The Goblin's Default Stats (Health, Damage, etc.):

        File: ServerScriptService/Foes/Goblin (ModuleScript)

        Code: Go to the Goblin.new() function.

        Tweak: Change the values in the finalStats table.
        Lua

    local finalStats = {
        Tier = 1,
        Health = 50,  -- < Change This
        Speed = 14,   -- < Change This
        Damage = 8    -- < Change This
    }





The Goblin's "Quirks" (e.g., "Strong" Goblins):

    File: ServerScriptService/Spawners/SpawnDirector (ModuleScript)

    Code: Go to the GenerateQuirks() function at the bottom.

    Tweak: You can change the chance of a quirk by editing self.Random:NextNumber(1, 10) == 1 (this is a 1-in-10 chance). You can change the stats it gives (e.g., newHealth, newDamage) in the same function.





The Goblin's Behavior (AI Logic):

    File: ServerScriptService/Foes/Goblin (ModuleScript)

    Code: Go to the Goblin:Attack() and Goblin:Patrol() functions.

    Tweak: These functions are currently just print() statements. This is where you would add your actual logic.

        In :Attack(): Play an animation, create a hitbox, deal damage to the target.

        In :Patrol(): Call self:MoveTo(someRandomPosition) to make the Goblin walk around.
