This system is designed to completely replace the default Backpack and StarterPack. It allows a player to acquire a "sword ownership" flag, save it permanently, and then use the 'G' key to equip or unequip that sword at any time.

🚀 How It Works: The Two-Phase Flow

The entire system is divided into two distinct phases:

Phase 1: Acquisition (One-Time Event)

    A player joins. The PlayerDataHandler script loads their data. If they are new, it creates a leaderstats.HasSword value, which is false.

    The player explores the "FORBIDDEN FOREST" and touches the "QUESTITEM" part.

    The SwordPickup script inside "QUESTITEM" fires on .Touched.

    It finds the player and checks their leaderstats.HasSword value.

    Since it's false, the script sets leaderstats.HasSword to true.

    The player now "owns" the sword. When they leave, PlayerDataHandler saves this true value to the DataStore.

Phase 2: Equipping (Constant Toggle)

    The player presses the 'G' key.

    The InputController (a LocalScript) detects this key press and fires the RequestEquipToggle RemoteEvent to the server.

    The EquipHandler (a server Script) is always listening for this event.

    It receives the signal, securely checks the player's leaderstats.HasSword value.

    If it's true, the script checks the player's Character:

        If the ClassicSword is found in the Character, the script Destroy()s it (unequipping).

        If the ClassicSword is not found, the script clones the master ClassicSword from ServerStorage and parents it to the Character (equipping).

🗂️ File-by-File Breakdown

Here is every file involved, where it lives, and what it does.

## ServerScriptService

This folder holds the "brain" of the system.

    Systems/PlayerDataHandler.server.lua

        What it is: The master data script.

        What it does: Creates, loads, and saves all persistent player data. It is responsible for creating the HasSword (BoolValue) and Kills (IntValue) inside leaderstats when a player joins, and saving their values to the DataStore when they leave.

    Systems/EquipHandler.server.lua

        What it is: The server-side "equip" brain.

        What it does: Listens for the RequestEquipToggle RemoteEvent. When it hears the signal, it performs the secure server-side check to see if the player owns the sword (HasSword == true). If they do, it handles cloning the tool from ServerStorage or destroying it from the Character.

## ServerStorage

This folder holds our "master copy" of items.

    ClassicSword (Tool)

        What it is: The master template of our sword.

        What it does: Sits here, hidden from players. The EquipHandler script clones this tool when the player equips. It contains the SwordScript that handles animations and damage.

## ReplicatedStorage

This folder holds our network communication channels.

    RequestEquipToggle (RemoteEvent)

        What it is: The secure network bridge.

        What it does: Allows the client (InputController) to send a "G key pressed" signal to the server (EquipHandler).

## Workspace

This folder holds the physical "trigger" for acquiring the sword.

    FORBIDDEN FOREST/QUESTITEM (Part)

        What it is: The physical pickup object.

        What it does: Must have its CanTouch property checked ON. It contains the SwordPickup script.

    FORBIDDEN FOREST/QUESTITEM/SwordPickup (Script)

        What it is: The acquisition script.

        What it does: Listens for the part.Touched event. When a valid player touches it, this script checks their HasSword value and sets it to true if it's currently false. This is the only way a player can gain ownership.

## StarterPlayer

This folder contains the client-side scripts.

    StarterPlayerScripts/InputController.client.lua (LocalScript)

        What it is: The client-side "G-key" listener.

        What it does: Uses UserInputService to detect when the 'G' key is pressed. It then fires the RequestEquipToggle RemoteEvent to the server.

        "Y" - throws the sword away

    StarterPlayerScripts/GuiManager.client.lua (LocalScript)

        What it is: The UI cleanup script.

        What it does: Runs once to tell StarterGui to disable the default backpack GUI. This is essential for our custom system.

## StarterPack

    This folder is empty.

        What it does: Nothing. By being empty, it ensures players do not spawn with any default items, which is critical for this system to work.
